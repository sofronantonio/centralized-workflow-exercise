# TIRAMISU

## INGREDIENTS
* 300 g Ladyfingers Savoiardi, about 30 cookies
* 500 g mascarpone cheese 1.1 pound
* 4 eggs
* 100 g granulated sugar ½ cup
* 300 ml coffee espresso, 1 ¼ cup
* 2 tablespoons Marsala Wine
* unsweetened cocoa powder for decoration

  
## INSTRUCTIONS
1) Prepare the coffee. Then add 2 tablespoons of Marsala wine. Set aside and let cool.
2) Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff. Once ready, set aside.
3) In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.
4) Pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone cheese.
5) Whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites. Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy
6) Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.
7) Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.
8) Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone cream generously.
9) Sprinkle with cocoa powder. Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Even better if you prepare the tiramisu the day before, letting it rest overnight.
